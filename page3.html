       <p><font size= 5><center>My hobbies and interests mainly include art and games. In terms of Art, I love drawing and painting. And for games, I love playing video games and I also have an interest in developing games, which is why I plan on joining the game design/development or computer science field. I spend most of my time either studying or playing different games, I especially spend a good amount of time playing "Valorant", out of all the games I've ever played, Valorant is my most favorite one!</center></font></p>
